# This is a highly experimental integration, use at your own risk!
#
# This integration ties up the Home Assistant conversation
# integration with the telegram_bot integration.
#
# If you have Telegram & Almond installed and configured,
# this integration will hook them up together.
#
# It passes chat flowing in from Telegram into Almond
# and sending back the response.
#
# This allows you to "Talk" to your Home Assistant in
# a more natural "Human" language.
#
# Requires telegram_bot to be set up.
