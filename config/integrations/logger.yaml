# The logger integration lets you define the level of logging activities
# in Home Assistant.
#
# I use this to reduce error messages for specific things,
# so I can focus on log messages that matter to me.

logger:
  default: warning

  filters:
    homeassistant:
      # This can happen during restart having Ingress tabs open.
      # I really don't care about it.

      # Yes I am aware, I develop on the thing, I don't rely on it...
      # Don't bother me about it again.

    homeassistant.util.yaml.loader:
      # I use YAML anchors and aliasses, causing duplicate keys in YAML.
      # For this use-case, that is on purpose, as an alias is used, but
      # with some overrides.
      # While a good warning, I'm going to disable it.
