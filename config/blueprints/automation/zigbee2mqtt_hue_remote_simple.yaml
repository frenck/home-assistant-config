blueprint:
  name: Zigbee2MQTT - Philips Hue Dimmer Remote Simple Light Control
  description: |
    A simple Hue Remote blueprint to control lights.

    The "on" button, turns on the lights to the last set brightness (unless
    the force brightness is toggled on in the blueprint). Holding the "on"
    button for a second, turns up the light to a 100% brightness instantly.

    Dim up/down buttons will change the brightness smoothly and can be pressed
    and hold until the brightness is satisfactory.

    Finally, the off button, turns the light off.
