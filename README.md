## About

This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, running my home automations.

As some of you might know, while I've developed the larger part of the Hass.io
add-ons, I did not use Home Assistant.
I've set up this repository to change that!

Follow me on my journey and be sure to hit the GitHub :star2:

## Where are all the other docs?

YO! Chill out bro. I've just started my journey.
Just like the configuration, the documentation needs to be written
and grow.

## Contributing

I consider my personal Home Assistant configuration an active open-source project.
