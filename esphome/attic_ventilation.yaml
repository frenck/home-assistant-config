# Attic Ventilation
#
# This ESPHome code is used on a Sonoff Dual R2.
# It controls our central ventilation system.
#
# The actual fan has 3 power inputs:
# 1: Should always get 230v (base voltag): Powers the device as well.
# 2: 230v input: Low speed.
# 3: 230v input: High speed.
#
# 1 is always on, 2 and 3 depends on the speed.
# Since there are only 2 speeds in that case, a SonOff Dual will do.
