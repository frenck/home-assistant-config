# DSMR Smart Bridge (Slimme brug)
#
# This is a DSMR bridge for the P1 port of my Dutch smart meter.
# It is a pre-assemled device from Marcel Zuidwijk, which I can
# highly recommend.
#
# https://www.zuidwijk.com
#
# This is my version of the configuration, bridge the DSMR serial
# on the network, allowing DSMR capable software to connect with it.
# Connect to it on port 6638.
#
# At the same time, it exposes ESPHome sensors with information on
# the device itself.
