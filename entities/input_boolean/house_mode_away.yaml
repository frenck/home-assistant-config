# Input boolean: House Away Mode
#
# With this input boolean the system know we are all away from home. Nobody is
# here.
#
# We general use the alarm system to determine this status, if we change the
# way to detect this, got a new alarm system, or would want to control this
# manually for once, this makes that possible.
