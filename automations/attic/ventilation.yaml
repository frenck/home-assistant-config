alias: "Attic Ventilation"
description: >-
  Controls the central ventilation system of the house.

  My central ventilation system is controlled by Sonoff Dual R2, running
  ESPHome. The ESPHome code can be found in the `esphome` folder, file:
  `attic_ventilation.yaml`.

  It handles two main cases:
    - The humidity of the bathroom.
    - Turn on ventilation when someone visits the restroom long enough to
      indicate it is a number 2 ;)

  Additionally, it:
    - Doesn't automatically interfere is the central ventilation is manually
      overridden.
    - Turns on the ventilation at high speed if shower use is detected
      (hot tap water is asked from the boiler).
    - When the house is in cleaning mode, ventilation is turned up to help
      when the floor is mopped.
    - Turns off the central ventilation when we go to sleep. We do want to
      be able to sleep in silence :)
