alias: "Kitchen Water Heater"
description: >-
  This automation tries to save energy usage on the water heater in
  our kitchen. Its a little water heater/boiler unit that keeps around
  15 liters of water at 80 degrees celcius.

  Eventhough heating it up in the morning again costs a lot of energy as well,
  it does lower the temperature difference between inside/outside the boiler
  causing less energy to be lost from that. In the morning we have solar
  power to help us out with heating it up again.
